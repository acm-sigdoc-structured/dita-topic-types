        <p>The most famous moon landing occurred on July 20, 1969, when NASA's Apollo 11 mission,
            commanded by Neil Armstrong, successfully landed on the Moon. Armstrong and astronaut
            Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins
            remained in orbit around the Moon in the command module.</p>
        <p>This article explores the most prominent landings (manned and unmanned) and one of the
            most important motivations for landings â€“ the quest for water. </p>
